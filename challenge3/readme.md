## Challenge 3 (stretch):
This is the basic crud app for users that we built. When I visit the page as a user I should be able to log in with the credentials
```
{
  username: "Admin",
  password: "200statuscode"
}
```

If the user doesn't match those credentials it should boot me back to the home page.

If the user trys to visit a page without being logged in then they should be redirected back to the login page.
